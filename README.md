British Squares is a text-based version of the boardgame of the same name. It was written forthe Rochester Institute of Technology's Computer Science for AP Students course.

British Squares is written entirely in Java and is meant to be run via command line. The game features three different AIs for the user to play agains (however, the user may also play against another user). The three AIs are "Good AI" which plays with a smart strategy, "Bad AI" which plays with a lazy strategy, and "Random AI" which does not use strategy and makes unpredictable choices. The project was to be a testimant to how well I understood the concepts of Inheritance and Object Oriented Programming, and it also had me experiment with the development of artificial intelligence.
